1. Input & Parsing
    Prompt the user to enter an expression in the format:

    <number> <operator> <number>  
    e.g., 5 + 3
    Accept these operators: +, -, *, /, %

Validate input:

    Only one operator allowed.

    Check for valid numeric input.

    Handle divide/mod by zero.

2. Operations
    Perform the operation and print the result.

    Use int for % and double for the other operators.

    Allow decimal inputs when applicable.

3. History Management
    Store each valid operation and its result (e.g., "5 + 3 = 8") in memory.

    Use an array of strings (char history[100][100] is one option).

    Up to 100 operations can be stored.

4. Menu Options
    After each operation, display a menu:

    [1] Continue
    [2] View History
    [3] Exit

5. View History
    If the user selects option 2, print all stored history.

6. Exit
    Cleanly exit the program when the user chooses option 3.

    
    
    
ðŸ§  Suggested Functions (Modular Design)
    void print_menu();

    int parse_input(char* input, double* num1, char* op, double* num2);

    double calculate(double num1, char op, double num2, int* error);

    void add_to_history(char history[][100], int* count, double num1, char op, double num2, double result);

    void print_history(char history[][100], int count);

    
    
ðŸ§ª Example Interaction

    Enter operation: 4 * 2
    Result: 8.00

    [1] Continue
    [2] View History
    [3] Exit
    > 1

    Enter operation: 10 / 0
    Error: Cannot divide by zero.

    [1] Continue
    [2] View History
    [3] Exit
    > 2

    History:
    4 * 2 = 8.00

    [1] Continue
    [2] View History
    [3] Exit
    > 3
    Goodbye!
